 Note that the development build is not optimized.
 To create a production build, run npm run build.



 cnpm install -g @vue/cli (or npm install -g @vue/cli)
 ##vue create my-project (create a project)
 vue create my-project-todolist

 Your connection to the default npm registry seems to be slow.
 Use https://registry.npm.taobao.org for faster installation? Yes

$ cd my-project-todolist
$ npm run serve (start server)
